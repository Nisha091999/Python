# i = 0  # Initialize the variable i to 0

# while i < 3:  # Start a while loop that continues while i is less than 3

#     print(i)  # Print the current value of i

#     i += 1  # Increment i by 1

# The while loop will run three times:

# 1. i is 0, so it prints 0 and increments i to 1.

# 2. i is 1, so it prints 1 and increments i to 2.

# 3. i is 2, so it prints 2 and increments i to 3.

# else:  # After the while loop is finished, execute the else block
#     print(0)  # Print 0
# The else block is executed once after the while loop is done.
# The output will be:

# 0

# 1

# 2

# 0Here's the step-by-step explanation of what happens:

# Initialize i to 0.
# The while loop checks if i is less than 3, which is true since i is 0.
# It enters the loop and prints the current value of i, which is 0.
# It then increments i by 1, making it 1.
# The loop iterates again since i (1) is still less than 3. It prints 1.
# i is incremented to 2, and the loop continues. It prints 2.
# After the third iteration, i becomes 3, and the condition i < 3 is no longer true.
# The loop terminates, and the code in the else block is executed, which prints 0.
