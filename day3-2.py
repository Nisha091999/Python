x = ['1']
x.extend('5234')
print(x)

# Solutions - 

# The above code will extend the list x with individual characters from the string '234',
# resulting in the list x containing each character as a separate element. 
# Here's the code execution step by step:

# x = ['1']: Initializes the list x with one element, which is the string '1'.

# x.extend('234'): Extends the list x with the characters from the string '234'. After this line of code,
# the list x will contain the following elements: ['1', '2', '3', '4'].

# print(x): Prints the contents of the list x, which will output: ['1', '2', '3', '4']

# So, the final result is a list containing the string '1' and the characters '2', '3', and '4' as separate elements.
