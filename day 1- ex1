st1 = {1, 2, 3, 5}
st2 = {2, 3, 4}
print(st2 -st1)

// This code snippet demonstrates the use of sets and the set difference operation in Python.

// st1 = {1, 2, 3}: This line creates a set named st1 containing the elements 1, 2, and 3.

// st2 = {2, 3, 4}: This line creates another set named st2 containing the elements 2, 3, and 4.

// print(st2 - st1): This line prints the result of the set difference operation between st2 and st1.

// The set difference operation, denoted by the - operator, returns a new set containing elements that are present in st2 but not in st1. In other words, it subtracts the elements of st1 from st2.

// In this case, the result of st2 - st1 would be a set containing only the element 4, because 2 and 3 are present in both st1 and st2, but 4 is present only in st2.

// So, the output of print(st2 - st1) would be {4}.
