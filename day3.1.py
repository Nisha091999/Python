s = 'clcoding'
x = slice(1,3)

print(s[x])

# Solutions - 

# The above code uses Python's slice notation to extract a portion of the string s using the slice object x. Here's how it works: 

# s = 'clcoding': This line initializes a string variable s with the value 'clcoding'.
# x = slice(1, 4): This line creates a slice object x that specifies a slice from index 1 (inclusive) to index 4 (exclusive).
# In other words, it selects the characters at positions 1, 2, and 3 in the string s.
# print(s[x]): This line uses the slice object x to extract the characters from the string s according to the specified slice. 
# The characters at positions 1, 2, and 3 in the string 'clcoding' are 'lco', and these characters are printed to the console.
# So, when you run the code, it will output: lco

# The slice s[x] extracts the characters from index 1 to 3 (4 is exclusive) in the string 'clcoding', which are 'lco'.
