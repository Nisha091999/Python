r= '123'
print(r.split())

----------------------------------------
The above code will split the string r into a list using the default whitespace separator, but since there are no whitespace characters in the string '123', it will not split the string, and you will get a list with the original string as its only element. Here's the output you would get: ['123']


The split() method without any arguments splits a string by whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.). Since '123' contains no whitespace characters, it remains as a single element in the list. If you want to split '123' into individual digits, you can use an empty string as the argument to the split() method like this:
r = '123'
print(r.split(''))

However, this will raise an error because an empty string cannot be used as a separator. If you want to split '123' into individual characters as strings, you can do it like this:

r = '123'
split_list = list(r)
print(split_list)

This will output:
['1', '2', '3']
