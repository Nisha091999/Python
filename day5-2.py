print('{0:.2f}'.format(1.0 / 3))


# output: 0.33

# 1.0 / 3: This part of the code calculates the division of 1.0 by 3, 
# which is equal to approximately 0.3333333333333333.

# '{}' is a string containing a placeholder enclosed in curly braces {}. 
# In this case, {0:.2f} is the placeholder. 
# The 0 inside the curly braces is used to specify the index of the argument to be inserted into the placeholder, 
# and .2f is a format specifier.

# :.2f is the format specifier inside the placeholder. Here's what it means:

# : separates the index (in this case, 0) from the format specifier.

# .2 specifies that you want to display the floating-point number with exactly two decimal places.

# f indicates that you want to format the number as a floating-point number.

# .format(...): This is the .format() method of the string. 
# It's used to replace the placeholder {0:.2f} with the value of 1.0 / 3 formatted according to the specified format.
# When you run this code, the 1.0 / 3 is calculated, resulting in the floating-point number 0.3333333333333333. 
# Then, the .format() method takes this value and formats it to display only two decimal places, 
# resulting in "0.33". Finally, the print() function displays "0.33" to the console.

# So, the output of this code is: 0.33 

# It formats the result of the division operation to have exactly two decimal places and prints it.
